        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>
          My Name is Simon <span><em>(but some call me Nyan)</em></span> and i
          do computer-stuff! i also do a lot of other stuff, but that is rarely
          as fun as computer-stuff! during the day i work as a
          systems-developer, helping customers in all kinds of buisnesses solve
          their daily problems. most of the time that evolves around making
          custom add-ins and increasing functionality in Office365! As a result,
          im really good at PowerPoint! not just using PowerPoint, but the
          advanced use of PowerPoint. before i started working with O365 i took
          a education in industrial automation, and i've made games on the side
          for about 3 years.

          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>
            with a vast coding experience, spanning several years of c# and
            unity, buisness projects with python, and customer-management
            systems in javascript. I am quickly and easily able to adapt to new
            technologies, if its software, web or anything between. using a
            plathora of technologies has allowed me to not get bogged down and
            stuck in any single language, framework, or technology. but instead
            to understand how to reason about and apply concepts from coding in any
            situation; Versatility is my key strength!

          <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
          <p>
            you'll always face problems in any project, and a really important
            skill is figuring out how to solve that problem as fast and
            effectively as possible, without making decissions that will
            compromise the project. with my broad experience i am able to see
            problems where unique technologies might be applied, and recognize
            problematic situations pre-emptively!
