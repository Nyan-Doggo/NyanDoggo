## SomeRPG and the problems with cameras!
### (28. nov 2020)
so i've been working on SomeRPG for a while now, it is a 3rd person Adventure RPG about
collecting cool items, however, there is a slight problem, see i made a [video](https://youtu.be/zriUTg_Tk8U) about
the cameras i used in the game, however, they dont necesarily work as well as i had hoped, so i've been spending
some time reworking the system. i am considering writing a post on what is going wrong here, im just kinda stuck
it seems, but i'll figure it out during the week, you can expect a new video next week about this!

those cameras? i havent done a video yet, but im considering it, strongly, maybe under the title
"Video Game Cameras, REEEEEEEEEE!!!", or maybe i'll choose something else. so my problem was two-fold.
let me first state: i am not a master at this, there might be a solution far simpler that i've come to ignore.
now then; imagine a point, this could be a car, a player character, your house... i guess not your house. preferably
something that moves about at a speed greater then 1 m/s along a surface, (walking and driving are good, jumping isnt as usefull)
what we want here, is simply to have two cameras, one of them is a orbital camera, and the other is a following camera,
if you can guess how they work i'll give you 2 points!

the orbital camera:
this is a simple device, partly, it is a camera. that takes in 2 angles, and a radius, it also takes in a base offset,
the process, is that we take our base offset and rotate it, along the cameras right hand side, or the x-axis in local space,
this gives us a vertical elevation, once we've used this method to adjust the hight of our camera, we then rotate our camera along the
local z-axis of the player, also known as "up", this gives us a rotation to the left or right of the player, finnaly we add our
radius to the cameras position, which is done thru normalizing the adjusted offset, so that the angle to the player remains the same,
but the distance becomes one, and then multiplying this with the radius we want.

the following camera:
this is also a relatively simple device, it follows the same principles as the orbital camera, but it does not take in
any input that dictates a horizontal rotation, that means the camera can adjust up and down, but can not rotate around the "up" axis,
so it will always remain behind the player.

## Moving over to GitHub!

i've switched to hosting all my stuff on Github Pages, this means i might use this as an oportunity to share all of my projects here:
resource-files and all, i'll also gather my sideprojects here, in the meantime you can check out my socials!
