## SomeRPG and the problems with cameras!
(28. nov 2020)

so i've been working on SomeRPG for a while now, it is a 3rd person Adventure RPG about
collecting cool items, however, there is a slight problem, see i made a [video](https://youtu.be/zriUTg_Tk8U) about
the cameras i used in the game, however, they dont necesarily work as well as i had hoped, so i've been spending
some time reworking the system. i am considering writing a post on what is going wrong here, im just kinda stuck
it seems, but i'll figure it out during the week, you can expect a new video next week about this!

## Moving over to GitHub!

i've switched to hosting all my stuff on Github Pages, this means i might use this as an oportunity to share all of my projects here:
resource-files and all, i'll also gather my sideprojects here, in the meantime you can check out my socials!
